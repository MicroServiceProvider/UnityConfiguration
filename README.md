UnityConfiguration
==================
Convention based configuration API for the Unity IoC container. Heavily influenced by StructureMap.

Configuring your container
--------------------------
You get access to the configuration api by using the extension method Configure on the IUnityContainer interface.

	var container = new UnityContainer();
	container.Configure(x =>
	{
		x.AddRegistry<FooRegistry>();
		x.AddRegistry(new BarRegistry());
	});

Working with registries
-----------------------
Configuration is done in one or several registries that inherit the UnityRegistry base class.

	public class FooRegistry : UnityRegistry
	{
		public FooRegistry()
		{
			// Scan one or several assemblies and auto register types based on a 
			// convention. You can also include or exclude certain types and/or 
			// namespaces using a filter.
			Scan(scan =>
			{
				scan.AssembliesInBaseDirectory();
				scan.ForRegistries();
				scan.With<FirstInterfaceConvention>();
				scan.With<AddAllConvention>()
					.TypesImplementing<IHaveManyImplementations>();
				scan.With<SetAllPropertiesConvention>().OfType<ILogger>();
				scan.ExcludeType<FooService>();
			});

			// Manually register a service
			Register<IFooService, FooService>().WithName("Foo").AsSingleton();

			// Make services a singleton. Useful for types registered by the scanner.
			Configure<ISingletonService>().AsSingleton();

			// If you want to inject values or objects that are not registered in
			// the container, you can do so by adding them using this statement.
			// For instances you want the container to create, just specify the type.
			Configure<ServiceWithCtorArgs>().WithConstructorArguments("some string", typeof (IFooService));

			// Unity follows the greedy constructor pattern when creating instances.
			// If you want to use a different constructor, you specify it by listing 
			// the types of the arguments in the constructor you want it to use.
			SelectConstructor<ServiceWithCtorArgs>(typeof (IFooService));

			// You can automatically configure the container to call
			// a method on any service when they are created
			AfterBuildingUp<IStartable>().Call((c, s) => s.Start());

			// You can automatically configure the container to 
			// decorate services when they are created
			AfterBuildingUp<IFooService>().DecorateWith((c, t) => new FooDecorator(t));
		}
	}
	
Custom conventions
------------------
At the moment, built in conventions includes AddAllConvention, FirstInterfaceConvention, NamingConvention, SetAllPropertiesConvention and ScanForRegistriesConvention. If these doesnï¿½t suit you, creating custom conventions is as easy as creating a class that implements the IAssemblyScanner interface.
	public class CustomConvention : IAssemblyScannerConvention
	{
		void IAssemblyScannerConvention.Process(Type type, IUnityRegistry registry)
		{
			if (type == typeof(FooService))
				registry.Register<IFooService, FooService>().WithName("Custom");
		}
	}
	
Release Notes
-------------

### vNext
* Added non-generic overload to the `AddAllConvention`
* Added option to scan for internal types in an assembly - `IAssemblyScanner.InternalTypes()`
* Strong named the assembly

### v1.3
* Documented public facing methods
* Included the xml documentation in the NuGet package
* Debugging symbols are available on SymbolSource.org
* Several more overloads for adding assemblies to the scanner
* One more overload for adding a registry that takes an instance of a UnityRegistry
* New convention that scans for registries
* New convention that uses an overridable naming convention for registering a type mapping
* MakeSingleton() and MakeSingleton(string) is marked as obsolete. Use Configure().AsSingleton() or Configure().WithName(name).AsSingleton() instead
* ConfigureCtorArgsFor(params object[] args) is marked as obsolete. Use Configure().WithConstructorArguments(params object[]) instead
* Added Transient, PerThread, PerResolve, ExternallyControlled and HierarchicalControlled lifetime scope configuration
